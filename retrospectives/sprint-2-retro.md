# Sprint Retrospective






## ✅ What Went Well?


- Using GitHub Copilot to help with coding backend was a successful attempt, help saving time by a lot.






## ⚠️ What Didn't Go Well?


- Rely too much on ai, sometime when the code provided by ai not works as intended, dev need a lot of time to fix since dev didn't write the code from scratch.

- Firebase un-relational database is very complicated to track complex data.







## 🎯 What Could We Improve?


- We should review and understand the AI-generated code before merging it, so we don’t get stuck fixing code we didn’t fully write.
- Keep the data model simple, use the Firebase Emulator for testing, and add small sync functions to keep duplicated (denormalized) data consistent.
